# Ye Unreleased Songs Catalog

This repo is the source code for a website I'm building. The purpose of it is for you to be able to access all of Ye's unreleased catalog without the hasle of searching for it in different places and websites. This is currently in VERY early alpha, so don't expect everything to be here right now.

If you have any suggestions on missing songs/albums, please, create an issue ticket here.
