Good Ass Job is one of many Kanye West's unreleased albums. It was supposed to be released after the iconic The College Dropout trilogy, but was not released due to a number of things happening in Kanye's life.

In 2003, even before releasing The College Dropout, Kanye was already teasing a quadrilogy, that being: The College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation and Good Ass Job.
\
\
The purpose of this quadrilogy was to show the average life we all expect to have: go to college, graduate and then get a good job. This album was supposed to show Kanye's evolution and maturity, exploring deeper topics.

Unfortunately, only two months after Graduation, Kanye's mom, Donda West, passed away. His mom was a very important figure to his life, as she was the one that motivated him to get into the music scene and to make his own career. If that event wasn't unfortunate enough, not long after Donda's passing, Kanye's at the time girlfriend broke up with him. This made Kanye extremely depressed, so he decided to focus on a completely new project called 808's and Heartbreak. This album was very emotionally charged and changed the music scene.

After the release of 808's and Heartbreak, Kanye continued to work on Good Ass Job. He worked on the project for the whole year of 2009, that was until a drastic event happened. At the VMAs of that year, Kanye jumped on stage while Taylor Swift was getting her Best Female Video award to tell the audience that Beyonc√© had one of the best videos of all time. After this incident, the media hated Kanye, as he was seen as a douchebag that just went into the stage to demoralize Taylor's award. Even Barack Obama at the time called him a asshole.\
Kanye seeing all the distress he had caused, isolated himself in Hawaii and started reworking Good Ass Job into what would be known as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasies.
