Job Well Done was going to be Ye's collab revisitation of the unreleased album of the name Good Ass Job. In the process of making this revisitation,
the names Good Ass Job and Job Well Done were used interchangeably, but most people call it simply Good Ass Job 2018.
\
\
Everything starts with The Life Of Pablo. As many know, Chance covers a big part of Ultralight Beam and was the motive for the song Waves being in the album.
Since Chance's first mixtapes, it's possible to see a big inspiration he had for Ye's early work, so for him to participate in a project of his and
also get shouted out in a live performance really meant Chance could participate more in future projects.
\
A fun fact about Ultralight Beam is that in one of Chance's verses, you can see him teasing the idea of a collab album with Ye, more specifically in
the verse:
\
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with Chance 3".
\
\
Only a few months after TLOP, Chance would release his new mixtape called The Coloring Book, where one of the songs would have a Ye feature,
only cementing their musical relation.
\
\
In 2018, after Ye took a hiatus from music due to him being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, he would start working on songs again, now in Wyoming.
This would be known as the "Wyoming Sessions". There, he would produce most of his projects of 2018, inclduing ye, Kids See Ghost, Daytona, etc.
\
Chance the Rapper would post multiple times him recording in these sessions but none of his contributions would appear on any song.
\
\
Later in the same year, after lots of teasing by Chance, Chance officially confirmed in an interview that him and Ye were producing a album together,
following the pattern of 7 songs and all of them produced by Ye, typical for that time period. Chance would continue to tease the album
and in July he would update everyone on the progress. By that time, the album was, according to him, 30% complete and Ye was confirmed to go to Chicago to produce the album and live there.
\
\
On September 17th of the same year, Chance would have an open mic event, where Ye would show up as a special guest. There, he stated that him and
Chance were producing an album called Good Ass Job. It is believed that this album would have this name because,
since Chance was a big fan of Ye's original trilogy, having an album called Good Ass Job (the name of the fourth and last album of the TCD quadrilogy)
would indicate the return of Ye's famous soul beats for this project.
\
\
Unfortunately for Chance, only a few months after announcing Good Ass Job, Ye would go to Uganda to inspire himself
artistically by the sounds there and the way people lived. After coming back, he would be very quiet for a little while, and would oficially
announce Jesus Is King, scrapping both Yandhi and Good Ass Job.
\
With no more options, Chance would take full control over the project, and a year later,
would release his infamous album The Big Day, which was almost universally hated.
\
\
Most of the songs in here are very unfinished, as the album wasn't really that developed before being scrapped. Aside from Clouted Up,
most of them have lots of mumbling and free verses, making the listening experience not that great.
