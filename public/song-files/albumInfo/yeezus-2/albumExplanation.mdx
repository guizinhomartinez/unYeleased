Yeezus II was going to be the continuation of Yeezus. From 2014 to 2016, a lot of songs and albums were created and scrapped,
and the result of all of this was The Life Of Pablo, a classical album that marked the era it was released.
Yeezus II was really not that important in the grand scheme of things, so it unfortunately wasn't really developed,
as it was supposed to be only an alternative version of Yeezus.

As a lot of people know, Yeezus was originally Thank God For Drugs, an album that had a total length of more than 3 hours.
Ye wasn't happy with this, so he decided to call Rick Ruben so that they could make a more cohesive project.
In the following weeks they worked together, it would be decided that the now named Yeezus was going to be only 40 minutes long,
with only 10 songs,
which at the time was unheard of in Ye's discography.
This decision was made in favor of a shorter and more understandable story for the listener to follow.

Ruben, in late 2013, confirmed that the original idea of Yeezus was 16 tracks,
but they decided to cut down the project, and at the interview, he said that there was content for 2 albums,
insinuating a follow-up project. Also, at the time, following the VMAs of 2013, Ye would work on the new project,
and it is most likely that the song "Awesome", a song dedicated to Kim Kardashian, was worked on,
since a song was later played that year in an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

In January 2014, an album cover would be made by Joe Perez.

Unfortunately, by winter of 2014, Ye decided to make Yeezus II its own thing,
instead of being an alternative version of another album.
This is believed to be the time Yeezus II was scrapped and So Help Me God began production.
