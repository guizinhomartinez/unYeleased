It's been a long time coming
Fresh new tires, I'm still running
It's a few things I'm overcoming
When the check's still clear, still

Think about it every night and day
To try to stay away, to keep my heart in here tucked
Don't take this as disrespect, I'm sitting here trying to redirect them
Think about it every night and day
To try to stay away, to keep my heart in here tucked
Don't take this as disrespect, I'm still here in a trifecta

Never put me down
Put me down, put me down, down, down
Never put me down
Put me down, put me down, down, down
