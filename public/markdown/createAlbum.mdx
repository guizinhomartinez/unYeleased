        # Custom albums

        This page is specifically on how to create custom albums, if you don't want to do this, then leave.\
        \
        The creation of a custom album is easy but hard to understand, so pay attention to everything.\
        Also, if you want the album to appear, you will need to first test it and then create a pull request on my GitHub (click on the GitHub icon at the navbar to acess it).\
        I plan to add a better way to make albums, but since that is a lot of code I have to do (which I don't know how to do it) this is the current process.

        ## How to add an album
    
        First, let's understand how albums are created.\
        As said previously, they are read from a JSON file, so let's take a look at a snipet of one and break it down.

        ```json showLineNumbers
        {
            "config": [
                {
                    "albumName": "Yandhi",
                    "albumCreator": "Kanye West",
                    "year": "2019",
                    "credits": "Credits to {Yehub} and ifyoufeelmypain for songs and tracklist."
                }
            ],
            "tracks": [
                {
                    "title": "Chakras",
                    "artist": "Kanye West",
                    "songLocation": "/song-files/songs//yandhi/Chakras.m4a"
                },
                {
                    "title": "Calm Before the Storm (Interlude)",
                    "artist": "Kanye West",
                    "songLocation": "/song-files/songs//yandhi/Calm Before The Storm 2.m4a"
                },
                {
                    "title": "The Storm",
                    "artist": "Kanye West",
                    "songLocation": "/song-files/songs//yandhi/The Storm.m4a"
                },
                ... rest of the code
            ]
        }
        ```
        This is pretty confusing for something who never messed with JSONs before, so let's break this down.
        This code:
        \
        \
        **General configs:**
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`albumName` Sets the name of the album;</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`albumCreator` Sets the name of the creator of the album;</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`year` Sets the year that the album was supposed to release/was cancelled;</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`credits` Is where you got the original song's files or the tracklist from;</li>
        \
        **Track-specific configs:**
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`title` Sets the name of the current track you're configuring</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`artist` Sets the name of the current track you're configuring</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`songLocation` Sets where the song is located. Please. Be sure to copy the way this is positioned here when adding this information.</li>
        \
        Now that we have that figured out, we can go to the next step.

        ## How to add the songs of the album

        At this point unfortunately you can't do this step without forking the project, so be sure to do that.\
        \
        Now, if you have the project, you will put all the song files in the `public/song-files` directory.
        First, create a folder with the name of the album, in lower case, and inside, put the files. The type of file doesn't matter, any type of file that
        plays sounds and doesn't have a video will do.
        \
        Now that we have that figured out, we can go to the next step.

        ## How to add the album to the homepage

        Go to `fetchAlbums.json`, which is inside the `public/song-files` directory. There, you should see something like this:

        ```json
        {
            "songs": [
                {
                    "year": "2025",
                    "row": 1,
                    "entries": [
                        {
                            "image": "/song-files/covers/bully-big.jpg",
                            "text": "Bully",
                            "subtext": "Beauty and the Beast",
                            "duration": "1:45",
                            "link": "/song/beauty-and-the-beast"
                        },
                        {
                            "image": "/song-files/covers/wheels-fall-off-big.jpg",
                            "text": "Wheels Fall Off",
                            "subtext": "Full Version",
                            "duration": "4:50",
                            "link": "/song/wheels-fall-off-full"
                        },
                        {
                            "image": "/song-files/covers/wheels-fall-off-big.jpg",
                            "text": "Wheels Fall Off",
                            "subtext": "Released Version (Clean)",
                            "duration": "2:01",
                            "link": "/song/wheels-fall-off-released"
                        }
                    ]
                },
            ... other albums
            ]
        }
        ```
        \
        Let's break this down.
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`year` Is the year the album was supposed to come out;</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`row` Is which row it should be at (just put the last row's number + 1);</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`image` Is the album's cover art;</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`text` Is the album's name;</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`subtext` Is just a description (put album for consistency purposes);</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`duration` Is the album's duration;</li>
        <li className='mt-2 ml-6'>`link` Is where the album is located (put `/album/album name here`).</li>
        \
        This should cover all parts of adding an album, so there it is, go create one!
