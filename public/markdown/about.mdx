        # About this website
    
        This website has the purpose to be a easy way for Ye fans to search for their favorite leaked albums/tracks.

        ## Why?

        I have been listening to Ye for about 2-3 years now, and something I have always been very uncomfortable with
        is the way fans have to find the leaked songs.
        \
        \
        If you want to know all the albums Ye has cancelled, you gotta go to a wiki page,
        which if you don't have a adblock is basicallly a sentence to death since its almost impossible to
        scroll without accidentally clicking on an ad.
        \
        \
        If you want to listen to songs, you first gotta see which version you want to listen to, then go to YouTube,
        search for it, THEN (maybe) you will find the correct version.
        \
        \
        If you want to listen to the whole album, you just pray that there is a playlist on Spotify
        or YouTube that has all the songs you're looking for.
        \
        \
        This website comes with the purpose of being a easy way for Ye fans to listen to the best versions of each song without all the hasle that comes with it.
        The whole project is open source, so if you feel like there is a missing song/album, you can just create a issue report or (even better) crete a Pull Request with that project!

        ## How

        The project is built with JSONs, so any album you would like to see in the project can be added with just a little bit of code.
        The descriptions of the albums and their lore are all built with MarkDown, so you can literally just type what you want to see and that will appear!
